# AML - Solution for Assignment 1

This paper contains solutions and explanations for various exercises related to hypothesis classes and PAC learning.

## Exercise 1

**a) Finite hypothesis class with specified VC dimension**

**b) Infinite hypothesis class with specified VC dimension**

## Exercise 2

### PAC Learnability of Hₐ ###

## Statement and Algorithm

Given X = ℝ² and Hₐ as the set of concepts defined by right triangles with catheti parallel to the axes and ratio AB/AC = α, we show that Hₐ is (ε, δ)-PAC learnable.

**Algorithm:**

Describe an algorithm A that can PAC learn Hₐ.

**Sample Complexity Bound:**

Provide an upper bound mₕ(ε, δ) on the sample complexity ensuring PAC-learnability.

## Exercise 3

### VC Dimension Calculation

Compute the VC dimension VCdim(H) for H = H₁ ∪ H₂ ∪ H₃, where H₁, H₂, and H₃ are defined in the paper.

## Exercise 4

### Shattering Coefficient and Growth Function

a) Compute the shattering coefficient τₕ(m) for the class H of 3-piece classifiers (signed intervals) over ℝ.

b) Compare τₕ(m) with the general upper bound for growth functions.

c) Discuss the existence of a hypothesis class H where τₕ(m) equals the general upper bound.

## Exercise 5

### VC Dimension of 1-decision lists

Show that the VC dimension of 1-decision lists over {0, 1}ⁿ is both lower and upper bounded by linear functions of n.
